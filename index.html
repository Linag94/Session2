    <h1>Coding and Film 2k21</h1>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
      In this unique 3 week program students learned what it is to be a programmer. In coding we focus on events, sequences, and loops with an emphasis on computer safety. In addition students learned block coding, HTML,and CSS. Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important for kids to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology around them.
      Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for the future. Coding helps children with
      communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.

    <h2>Film</h2>
    <p>
      Students learned the basics and foundations of film by using camera angles, camera shots, lighting, stop animation, storyboarding, directing,
      special effects and editing to create their own stories and visual art. The class worked collectively together and formulated their own idea to create a "Kids News" TV
      style show and worked with a fellow classmate to help them create an "Esngcape Room" film by playing different roles in front of the camera and on set.
